# Advent of Code 2023
My proposed solutions for Advent of Code 2023

## How to run
```bash
poetry run python run.py -d <day> -p <part>
```
for other options, run
```bash
poetry run python run.py --h
```

if you prefer to run the code directly, you can do so by running
```bash
cd day<day>
poetry run python solver.py -p <part>
```
